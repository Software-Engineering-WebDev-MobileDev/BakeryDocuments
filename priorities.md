# 1. Must-Have Features:
These are essential features that must be included in the MVP for the application to be functional and valuable to users.

* User login and authentication
* Basic task management (create, assign, view status)
* Recipe management (view, search)
* Ingredient management (view inventory)
# 2. Should-Have Features:
These features are highly desirable and should be included if possible, but they might not be strictly necessary for the MVP.

* Recipe scaling
* Task prioritization
* Inventory tracking and alerts
* Employee management (create, edit, delete accounts)
# 3. Could-Have Features:
These features are nice-to-have but can be deferred or potentially cut if necessary to meet the project's timeline and resource constraints.

* Advanced reporting and analytics
* Mobile app features (beyond basic task management)
* Integration with other systems (e.g., POS, accounting)
